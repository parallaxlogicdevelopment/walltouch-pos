# Sales Invoice SMS Implementation - Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented sales invoice SMS functionality in SellPosController.php with the user's specific message format.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Changes Made to SellPosController.php

#### Added SendsSms Trait
```php
use App\Utils\SendsSms;
```

#### Added trait usage to class
```php
class SellPosController extends Controller
{
    use SendsSms;
    // ... rest of class
}
```

#### Updated SMS call in store method (line ~603)
```php
// Send SMS notification if customer has mobile number (non-blocking)
if (!empty($ci['mobile'])) {
    try {
        $this->sendSaleInvoiceSms($transaction, $business);
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        // Log SMS errors but don't stop transaction processing
        \Log::emergency('SMS error in store method: ' . $e->getMessage());
    }
}
```

#### Added sendSaleInvoiceSms method
```php
/**
 * Send sale invoice SMS to customer
 */
private function sendSaleInvoiceSms($transaction, $business)
{
    try {
        if (empty($transaction->contact->mobile) || !$this->isSmsConfigured($business->id)) {
            return;
        }

        // Get previous due (total due - current transaction due)
        $current_due = $transaction->final_total - $transaction->total_paid;
        $total_due = $transaction->contact->getTotalDue($business->id);
        $previous_due = $total_due - $current_due;

        // Format the SMS message
        $message = "Invoice#{$transaction->invoice_no} | " .
                  "Bill: ৳" . number_format($transaction->final_total, 2) . " | " .
                  "Prev Due: ৳" . number_format($previous_due, 2) . " | " .
                  "Outstanding: ৳" . number_format($total_due, 2) . " | " .
                  "অর্ডারের জন্য আন্তরিক ধন্যবাদ – WALL TOUCH, Hotline: 01712968571";

        $this->sendSms($transaction->contact->mobile, $message, $business->id);
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        // Log error but don't block the transaction
        \Log::error('Sale invoice SMS failed: ' . $e->getMessage());
    }
}
```

## Message Format Implemented
The SMS message follows the exact format requested:
```
Invoice#[Invoice No] | Bill: ৳[Amount] | Prev Due: ৳[Prev Due] | Outstanding: ৳[Total Due] | অর্ডারের জন্য আন্তরিক ধন্যবাদ – WALL TOUCH, Hotline: 01712968571
```

### Example SMS Output
```
Invoice#INV-2024-001 | Bill: ৳1,500.00 | Prev Due: ৳500.00 | Outstanding: ৳2,000.00 | অর্ডারের জন্য আন্তরিক ধন্যবাদ – WALL TOUCH, Hotline: 01712968571
```

## Key Features

- Gets total customer due from database
- Computes previous due (total - current)

### 2. Non-blocking Implementation
- SMS failure won't affect transaction completion
- Comprehensive error logging
- Try-catch blocks prevent crashes

### 3. Conditional Sending
- Only sends if customer has mobile number
- Only sends if SMS is configured for business
- Respects business SMS settings

### 4. Bengali Text Support
- UTF-8 encoded Bengali thank you message
- Proper formatting for bilingual content
