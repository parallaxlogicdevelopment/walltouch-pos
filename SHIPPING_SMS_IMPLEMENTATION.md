# Shipping Details SMS Implementation - Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented shipping details SMS functionality in SellController.php with the user's specific Bengali message format.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Changes Made to SellController.php

#### Added SendsSms Trait Import
```php
use App\Utils\SendsSms;
```

#### Added trait usage to class
```php
class SellController extends Controller
{
    use SendsSms;
    // ... rest of class
}
```

#### Updated updateShipping method
Enhanced the method to include SMS functionality:
```php
// Load contact relationship
$transaction = Transaction::where('business_id', $business_id)
                    ->with('contact')
                    ->findOrFail($id);

// After updating shipping details
$business = Business::find($business_id);
$this->sendShippingSms($transaction, $business);
```

#### Added sendShippingSms method
```php
/**
 * Send shipping SMS to customer
 */
private function sendShippingSms($transaction, $business)
{
    try {
        if (empty($transaction->contact->mobile) || !$this->isSmsConfigured($business->id)) {
            return;
        }

        // Prepare shipping information for SMS
        $shipping_info = [];
        
        if (!empty($transaction->shipping_details)) {
            $shipping_info[] = $transaction->shipping_details;
        }
        
        if (!empty($transaction->shipping_address)) {
            $shipping_info[] = $transaction->shipping_address;
        }
        
        if (!empty($transaction->shipping_status)) {
            $shipping_info[] = "Status: " . $transaction->shipping_status;
        }
        
        if (!empty($transaction->delivered_to)) {
            $shipping_info[] = "Delivered to: " . $transaction->delivered_to;
        }

        // Add custom shipping fields if they exist
        for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
            $field = "shipping_custom_field_{$i}";
            if (!empty($transaction->$field)) {
                $shipping_info[] = $transaction->$field;
            }
        }

        $shipping_details = !empty($shipping_info) ? implode(' | ', $shipping_info) : 'Updated';

        // Format the SMS message as requested
        $message = "আপনার পণ্য পাঠানো হয়েছে। Shipping Details: {$shipping_details} | – WALL TOUCH, Hotline: 01712968571";

        $this->sendSms($transaction->contact->mobile, $message, $business->id);
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        // Log error but don't block the shipping update
        \Log::error('Shipping SMS failed: ' . $e->getMessage());
    }
}
```

## Message Format Implemented
The SMS message follows the exact format requested:
```
আপনার পণ্য পাঠানো হয়েছে। Shipping Details: [Shipping Info] | – WALL TOUCH, Hotline: 01712968571
```

```

```

5. SMS is sent (non-blocking)
6. Success response is returned

The SMS includes information from these fields:
- `shipping_details` - Main shipping information
- `shipping_address` - Delivery address
- `shipping_status` - Current shipping status
- `delivered_to` - Recipient name
- `shipping_custom_field_1` to `shipping_custom_field_5` - Custom fields

### Dependencies Used
- `SendsSms` trait for SMS functionality
- `Transaction::contact()` relationship
- `Business` model for SMS configuration
- Eager loading with `->with('contact')`

## Location in System
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/SellController.php`
- **Route**: `PUT /sell/{id}/update-shipping` (via SellController@updateShipping)
- **Frontend Access**: "Sale > All Sales > Action > Edit Shipping > Shipping Details"
- **Method**: SMS triggered in `updateShipping()` method after successful update
